It's been a tough two years. Ever since the COVID outbreak, nothing is as before. Masks, sanitizer, announcements, social distancing, etc. has now become a part of our life. Though there are less restrictions compared to a year before, one can still see and feel the impact. Recently I have been to Varanasi, Benaras, the oldest city in the world, to attend my cousinâ€™s wedding. I would say it really is not easy to travel somewhere with travel restrictions. But somehow I managed. I have been to many places there. I even got to witness the holy Ganga Arti. Overall it was a good experience. It's been almost a year now.

Being confined to my room for almost two years, Now I am worried more about my mental health than my physical health. And it's not just about me. I could really sense that anxiety, that fear, that tension, that has stuck like a leech to the people around me. I think we all need a break, not to sit at home but to go out and breathe in the middle of mother nature.

Talking about nature. For some, nature corresponds to the lush greenery of tropical rainforest, for some it is sizzling valleys of kashmir, for some it is the beaches of south india and so on. But for me nature has a very special meaning. It's more of an experience than a memory to me. Let me share my experience.

It was 4:45 in the morning and the month was november. The room lit up with brightness. Gradually the birds chirping got louder. The lowing of cows nearby made me realize it's morning. I woke up from the bed and walked out of the room into the front yard which was just before the road. The bell rang ding-ding and the postman passed away on his bicycle, the milkman was up on his way to homes nearby carrying two baskets of milk, each on one hand, the neighbor was preparing fodder, I saw people chewing neem twig so as to clean their teeth, there was smell of burning eathen pot all around, i could see the visible smoke of coal burning at a distant home, the environment was full of energy, i could see the bright sky as far as i can  with sun just about to rise above the clouds. It was an enriching experience.

After i finished my daily routine. I saw neighbors and my family members having a chat below the open sky. I sat with everyone out there on a Khatiya (cot). My aunt came out and served all of us  a cup of ginger tea. We talked about everything from farming to politics, to the education system to weather and so on. As soon as the clock struck 7, everyone went to their jobs. Me and my cousins decided to go and have a dip in the river Ganga, so we took our clothes and went. We also went to the Dhala (A roadside market in a village). The dhala was buzzing with people all around. We reached the Ganga ghat (a passage leading to a river) and had a few dips in the holy river. We then came home.

At around 10 in the morning, my aunt served us hot Paratha with Aloo bhujia, mint chutney and mango pickle. It was a delight to my tongue. Moreover, having lunch below the open sky at such a place just made the joy even more enriching.

I walked down the village with my cousins, I made some new friends who were really funny, we played cricket and we drank some sattu and we came home by the evening.

It was a wonderful experience.
Villages are great examples of a good bond between nature and humans. And a day at the village is the closest to an amazing day between mother nature for me.
