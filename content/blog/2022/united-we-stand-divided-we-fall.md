<p style="font-style: italic;">Where the path goes dark and the fear makes you fall,<br>
The bat wakes up and the demons crawl,<br>
However, help you may need,<br>
Yet the mind goes numb and the heart can't take a call,<br>
But stand you still,<br>
And face it all,<br>
Losses break your heart,<br>
But Never can it break your soul,<br>
Failures break your motivation,<br>
But Never can it break your determination as a whole,<br>
What thoughts and emotions can't,<br>
The hope may shall,<br>
What wealth and wisdom can't,<br>
The unity may shall,<br>
Because united we stand, divided we fall.</p>
