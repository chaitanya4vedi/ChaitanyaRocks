I am a 21 year old recent graduate. I live in India, West Bengal in the city of joy. I live with my parents and two older brothers. I spend most of my days coding, writing stories, drawing, taking photos, and making videos. I also write poems, mostly in hindi. I went to an open mic show some years ago and I got a pretty good response. Though I am not a science and technology nerd, it's the longing to know the unknown possibilities that makes me really curious to read and write about science and technology. I also like history. I made this website using Hugo which is a static site generator. I have a few other websites.

i know its pretty much boring reading all this. So let's make it a bit interesting and probably add some flavors.

I am a 21 year old virgin. I am broke and single. Till the age of fifteen I used to think that girls have the same intimate parts as the boys except breasts. My one and only crush was my 5th grade English teacher. I was fifteen when I watched a porn video for the first time and I almost got unconscious after I saw naked girl in the porn video.

I’ve always been a rank holder. I excelled at every subject except physics, chemistry and math. The least I scored ever in life was 05/50 in math in third grade. I used to watch a lot of English cartoon shows and everyone thought books were the reason for my English writing skills. I started writing poems when I was around eight years old. I drew a perfect portrait of my friend when I was seven years old. The time I really cried was when I scored the highest but couldn’t get a rank because I failed in math.

From third grade I was able to explain a few english paragraphs from my textbooks to hindi and from sixth grade I started writing answers on my own while the teachers recommended writing it exactly as it's in the textbooks. What I did was exceptional for teachers and students of my class. And that's why I really became the center of attention in my school.

I used to have fun having dinner at parties, playing video games, flying in the sky, fighting with villains and then suddenly in the middle of enjoyment I always got the urge to pee.Then I peacefully empty my bladder in the bathroom only to wake up with a wet bed and realize it was all just a dream. This happened last when I was around ten years old.

My first drawing was sold for ₹50. I then felt guilty for selling it and decided to buy it back but couldn’t because the buyer was charging me ₹ 500.

I have always been the monitor of my class. I have also been the school captain and got the opportunity to hold the school flag at the march past and no doubt i accidentally dropped the flag in the middle of parade.

Though I am not an avid traveler, I do love going to new places. I have been to a few places around india. I wish to visit the USA and Europe someday. 

I don't remember what I thought of becoming when I was a kid. But as I grew up I still didn't know what I wanted to become. Sometimes I think of devoting my life to the service of people. I really feel the urge to make people's life better by making them aware and helping them achieve more. I am not really sure of what I will become, I want to know where my destiny takes me. 

Hello, i am Chaitanya and...
