I still remember those days. When I was a kid, after playing for a day, tired and exhausted, I used to sit on a stone stair that goes to the fourth floor where my home was located. Though blurry I still kind of have that memory, the sunset, birds getting back to their nest, bells of evening prayer from distant homes, the smell of earth coming from uncoloured buildings. I know we can certainly capture and record moments but I always wish we had some devices to capture experiences also. Anyways for now words are my only way to replicate and have those experiences captured as long as i want. And this is what my blog is all about. With my blog I try to capture my feelings, imagination and experiences for anytime I want to go through it. It's for today, tomorrow and time to come.

In case you want to know about me [here](https://chaitanya.rocks/blog/2022/i-am/) it is.
